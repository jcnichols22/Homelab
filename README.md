# üë®üèª‚Äçüíª Homelab

**Last Updated:** June 24th, 2025  
**Primary Purpose:**  
To provide a secure, self-hosted environment for network management, automation, and media streaming. This homelab leverages Proxmox virtualization, Docker containers, and a flat network architecture to deliver critical services (DNS, ad-blocking, monitoring, automation) and a robust media stack, all managed with strong security (Tailscale VPN), centralized documentation, and automated backups and updates.

- **OS:** Proxmox VE 8.0
- **Specs:** i5-7500T | 16GB RAM | 500GB SSD
- **Role:** Hosts critical network services in LXC containers

### Media Server

- **Platform:** HP ProDesk 600 G3 SFF
- **OS:** Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS
- **Specs:** i5-8500 | 16GB RAM | 500GB NVME | 1TB Media Storage

## üîí Secure Connectivity: Tailscale Mesh VPN

All core devices, services, and management interfaces are securely connected via Tailscale, creating a private WireGuard-based mesh network overlay across the entire homelab infrastructure.
This enables:

- Secure remote access to all services from anywhere, without exposing ports to the public internet.

- Seamless inter-device communication across physical locations and networks.

- Simple device onboarding and access control via Tailscale ACLs.
